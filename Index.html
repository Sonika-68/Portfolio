        <p>After the Potter films ended, Watson began to look for more mature roles. Her first major part was in the
            drama The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012), in which she played a high-school senior who becomes friends
            with a clinically depressed freshman. She subsequently appeared in the crime drama The Bling Ring (2013),
            the historical thriller The Colony (also known as Colonia; 2015), and the sci-fi thriller The Circle (2017).
            These films had limited success at the box-office, but Watson had another blockbuster hit with the
            live-action Disney
            adaptation (2017) of Beauty and the Beast. In 2019 she appeared as Meg March in Greta Gerwig’s acclaimed
            Little Women,which was based on Louisa May Alcott’s classic children’s book.
            <br>
            Meanwhile, in the midst of her acting career, Watson pursued a college degree. In 2009 she began attending
            Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. She took time off as needed for filming, and she also studied
            for a year at the University of Oxford. Watson graduated from Brown in 2014 with a bachelor’s degree in
            English
            literature. That year she was named a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador. She was an advocate for women’s rights
            and gender equality. From 2016 to 2020 Watson ran an online feminist book club, Our Shared Shelf, to read
            and discuss
            books by and about women.
